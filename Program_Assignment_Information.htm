<p>Program #1 Plane-Line Intersection <b>12.5%</b><br>
  Due: 09/26/2016<br>
  Assignment: </p>

<p>
<b>Background</b>
</p><p>

In computer graphics, it is frequently necessary to compute the location where a line
intersects a plane.  One important case is to determine which items are actually visible to the
camera and need to be rendered, and which can be ignored.  This can greatly increase the speed of rendering
the scene.  As many items are partly visible to the camera, the location where lines intersect the planes
that define the visible region must be computed, rendering part of the line and ignoring part.

</p><p>
<b>Equation of a Plane</b>
</p><p>

The equation of a plane is:
</p><p>
<b>n.(P - P0) = 0</b>, where n is the <b>normal</b> to the plane, P0 is a point on the plane, P-P0 is <b>point-point subtraction</b>,
and n.(P-P0) is the <b>dot product</b> between n and (P-P0).
</p><p>

Point-point subtraction is performed by subtracting each component of the second point from the corresponding
component of the first point, creating a <b>vector</b> (a direction).

</p><p>

The normal to the plane (the direction that points away from the plane) can be computed with three points and the cross product:<br>
n = (PB - PA) x (PC - PA) where PA, PB, and PC are three points on the plane, and point-point subtraction has been used.

</p><p>

The cross product is computed as:
</p><p>

a x b (a cross b) = <br>
        a_y*b_z - a_z*b_y  (the first component of a x b)<br>
	a_z*b_x - a_x*b_z  (the second component of a x b)<br>
        a_x*b_y - a_y*b_x  (the third component of a x b)<br>

</p><p>

The dot product is computed as:

</p><p>
a.b (a dot b) = a_x*b_x + a_y*b_y + a_z*b_z<br>
where a_x is the first component of a, etc.<br>
note: the dot product is just a number, a <b>scalar</b>
</p><p>

</p><p>
<b>Parametric Equation of a Line</b>
</p><p>

The <b>parametric</b> equation of a line is:
</p><p>
P(&#945;) = (1-&#945;)P1 + &#945;*P2, where P1 and P2 are points on the line, and &#945; is a scalar.<br>
Note that when &#945; is 0, P(&#945;) = P1, and when &#945; is 1, P(&#945;) is P2.  The other
points on the line are obtained by letting &#945; take on other values.

</p><p>

The dot product represents the cosine of the angle between the two vectors.  If that dot product must be 0, then the angle
between the vectors must be 90 degrees.  Since n is the direction away from the plane, it already makes an angle of 90 degrees
with the plane.  This means that the direction (P-P0) must have no component out of the plane.  As P0 is known to be a point
on the plane, P must also be on the plane for the equation to hold.

</p><p>

To identify a point that is both on the line and on the plane, simply plug in the parametric equation of a line into
the equation for the plane and solve for &#945;.

</p><p>

&#945; = n.(P0-P1)/n.(P2-P1), where P0 is the point on the plane, P1 and P2 are the points on the line

</p><p>

Finally, plug this &#945; into the parametric equation of the line and you have the point of intersection.

</p><p>
<b>Program Details</b>
</p><p>

Write a program to allow the user to input three points that define a plane, and two points that define a line.
Use this data to compute the point of intersection between the plane and the line, as outlined above.
You may assume that the line will generate exactly one intersection point with the plane.
You may assume that all data can be stored in WORDs (although temporary computations
can make use of the DWORD registers).  There is a division in the computation of &#945;.  In order
to maintain accuracy, store the numerator and denominator for &#945; separately, performing the division at the very end
when the two decimal places are also computed.

</p><p>

<b>I expect lots of macros</b>.  Use macros for input, output, and computations.

<p>
<b>Background</b>
<p>

In computer graphics, it is convenient to render the scene with the camera at the
origin and pointed in the <b>negative</b> z-direction.  However, we want to be able
to position the camera anywhere and render the scene.  This means that we must
transform from &quot;world&quot; coordinates to &quot;camera&quot; 
(or &quot;eye&quot;) coordinates. To accomplish this, the user must provide 3
pieces of information (read in from an input file, refer to the example figure):

<p>

<ul>
   <li>the location (x,y,z) of the camera in &quot;world&quot; coordinates (<b>eye point, E</b>)</li>
   <li>the location (x,y,z) that the camera is pointed at (<b>at point, A</b>)</li>
   <li>the direction (x,y,z) that is &quot;up&quot; for the camera (<b>up vector, v_up</b>)</li>
</ul>

<p>

After obtaining the three coordinates for one of the above items, repeat the input
in the form of an ordered triplet (x, y, z).

<p>

Using these supplied values, it is possible to construct a coordinate system
where the camera is pointed along one of the coordinate axes. Then we can 
take all of our objects in world coordinates and transform them into camera coordinates.
Instead of (x,y,z), the camera coordinates are usually labeled (u,v,n).

<p>
<b>Computing n</b>
<p>

The view normal (n) is easily obtained through point-point subtraction.  Simply
subtract the at point from the eye point (E - A) coordinate by coordinate.
This is the direction along which the camera is pointed.  Note that the camera
is pointed in the <b>negative</b> n-direction.

<p>
<b>Computing v</b>
<p>

Obtaining v is more complex.  First, v must be in the same plane as n and the up vector.
This means that it is a <b>linear combination</b> of n and v_up which we can write as:

<p>
v = &alpha;*n + &beta;*v_up
<p>

In addition, v must be orthogonal (at a right angle) to n (just as x, y, and
z are all orthogonal to one another).  We can use the <b>dot product</b> to enforce this requirement.

<p>
a.b (a dot b) = a_x*b_x + a_y*b_y + a_z*b_z (an obvious candidate for a macro)<br>
where a_x is the first component of a, etc.<br>
note: the dot product is just a number, a <b>scalar</b>
<p>

If two vectors are orthogonal, then their dot product is 0.  Let's take the dot product
of our formula for v with n:

<p>
0 = &alpha;*(n.n) + &beta;*(v_up.n), which means that (solving for &alpha; and substituting)<br>
(n.n)v = -&beta;(v_up.n)n + &beta;(n.n)v_up
<p>

To find (n.n)v, you will need to perform <b>vector-scalar multiplication</b> and
<b>vector_vector addition</b>.  First, you need to compute -&beta;(v_up.n), which is just a scalar.
Then, multiply this scalar by <b>each component</b> of n to obtain each
component of -&beta;(v_up.n)n.  Now, add the components of -&beta;(v_up.n)n
and &beta;(n.n)v_up together, component-by-component, to obtain (n.n)v.

<p>

I have multiplied v through by n.n (again, just a number) so that I can avoid doing division.
When doing any integer arithmetic, we want to do the division last so that the 
rounding error involved in division does not
accumulate with each subsequent arithmetic operation.
This will not affect my answer as multiplying a vector by a scalar changes its length,
but not its direction.
In fact, since we are not concerned with the length of v, just its direction, we can
set (n.n)/&beta; = 1.

<p>
v = -(v_up.n)n + (n.n)v_up
<p>

<p>
<b>Computing u</b>
<p> 

The last vector in our new coordinate system is u.  It is obtained simply by noting
that it must be orthogonal to both v and n.  We can use the <b>cross product</b>
to obtain u.  The cross product of two vectors gives a third vector orthogonal to the
first two.  Note that you will actually obtain (n.n)u, but again, this is okay.

<p>
a x b (a cross b) = <br>
        a_y*b_z - a_z*b_y  (the first component of a x b)<br>
	a_z*b_x - a_x*b_z  (the second component of a x b)<br>
        a_x*b_y - a_y*b_x  (the third component of a x b)<br>
<p>

<p>
<b>Normalization</b>
<p>

For the transformation to camera-coordinates to work correctly, the lengths of 
each of our 3 vectors must be 1.  The dot product can be used to obtain the length of 
a vector:

<p>
a_len = &radic;a.a
<p>

To <b>normalize</b> a vector, simply divide each component of the vector
by the length of the vector.  Thus, the division is done as the very last arithmetic
operation.  In fact (refer to the example figure), we can avoid division error
by reporting our results as a rational number.  In this way, the only error
present is the error associated with finding the square root (done using sqrt.h and
sqrt.obj).

<p>

<b>Use the provided batch file (<a href = "3410programs/program1/build.bat">build.bat</a>)

<p>Program #2 Vankin's Mile <b>12.5%</b><br>
  Due: 10/12/2016<br>
  Assignment: </p>

<p>

<b>Vankin’s Mile</b> is a solitaire game played on an n x m grid. 
The player starts by placing a token on any square of the grid. 
Then on each turn, the player moves the token either one square to the right or one square down. 
The game ends when player moves the token off the edge of the board. 
Each square of the grid has a numerical value, which could be positive, negative, or zero. 
The player starts with a score of zero; whenever the token lands on a square, the player adds its value to his/her score. 
The object of the game is to score as many points as possible. 
For example, given the grid below, the player can score 8+11+7-3+4 = 27 points by placing 
the initial token on the 8 in the second row, and then moving down, down, right, down, down.

<p>Program #3 Newton's Interpolating Polynomials <b>12.5%</b><br>
  Due: 11/02/2016<br>
  Assignment: </p>

<p>
<b>Background</b>
</p><p>

You are provided with a set of data points.  That is, for several values
of an independent variable x, you have the corresponding measurement for a dependent variable, y = f(x).
The true underlying functional relationship between x and y is not known, however.  Furthermore, you
need to know the dependent variable y for other values of the independent variable x.  One way to estimate
the dependent variable values is to use <b>Newton's interpolating polynomials</b>.  It is possible
to fit the known data points to a polynomial and to use the polynomial to obtain the required dependent variable values.

</p><p>

Newton's interpolating polynomials take the following form:

</p><p>

f(x) = b<sub>0</sub> + b<sub>1</sub>*(x - x<sub>0</sub>) + b<sub>2</sub>*(x - x<sub>0</sub>)*(x - x<sub>1</sub>) + b<sub>3</sub>*(x - x<sub>0</sub>)*(x - x<sub>1</sub>)*(x - x<sub>2</sub>) + ... <br>
where x<sub>0</sub>, x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub> are independent variable values corresponding to known data points, <br>
and b<sub>0</sub>, b<sub>1</sub>, b<sub>2</sub> are determined as follows: <br>
given that f[x<sub>n</sub>...x<sub>m</sub>] = (f[x<sub>n</sub>...x<sub>m + 1</sub>] - f[x<sub>n - 1</sub>...x<sub>m</sub>])/(x<sub>n</sub> - x<sub>m</sub>) for (n &gt;= m)<br>
and f[x<sub>n</sub>...x<sub>n</sub>] = f(x<sub>n</sub>) (the <b>base case</b>) <br>
then b<sub>n</sub> = f[x<sub>n</sub>...x<sub>0</sub>] <br>

</p><p>

<b>The definition for the b's is recursive</b>!

</p><p>

After the b's have been computed, everything on the right hand side of the equation for f(x) (= y) is known.
Remember that x is just the user specified independent variable value under investigation. 
Simply plug in for x and perform the arithmetic to obtain the interpolated y.

</p><p>

Note that investigating known (data point) x-values should result in interpolated y-values that match the known data y-values.

</p><p>
<b>Sorted Points</b>
</p><p>

To ensure that the interpolated value for y is as accurate as possible, the known data points should be <b>sorted</b> based
on the distance from the user specified x.  That is, x<sub>0</sub> should be the data point that is closest to
the specified x, x<sub>1</sub> the next closest, etc.  
This is done with a sort that subtracts the data point 
x-value from the user specified x-value and takes absolute value (fabs).  
The sort places the points in ascending order based on this computation.  
<b>This sort procedure has been done for you</b>.

</p><p>

</ul>

<p>
<b>Global Data</b>
</p><p>

Compute the bs as you need them in the interpolate procedure (don't store the bs).

</p><p>
<b>Polynomial Degree</b>
</p><p>

Using more of the known data points to estimate the desired value of the dependent variable increases the accuracy
of the estimate by increasing the degree of the polynomial.  Generally, polynomials of degree 3 (cubics) or lower
are sufficient for interpolation.  This means that not all of the known data points will be used.  In the case
of linear interpolation, only x<sub>0</sub>, f(x<sub>0</sub>), x<sub>1</sub>, and f(x<sub>1</sub>) will be used.

</p><p>
<b>Program I/O</b>
</p><p>

First, ask the user for the independent variable x-value to be investigated and the degree of the
interpolating polynomial.  These values should be the first two lines of the input file.
Next, read the known data points (REAL4s) of the polynomial in from the text file, storing them in an array.
The (x, y) pairs are listed together (on separate lines) in the text file.
Store (x, y) pairs together in the array.  Sort the points before interpolating.
The program outputs the interpolated y-value for the requested x-value.

<p>Program #4 Fallout 3 Computer Hacking <b>12.5%</b><br>
  Due: 11/28/2016<br>
  Assignment: </p>

<p>

In Fallout 3, sometimes it is necessary to hack computers.  
When hacking is attempted (assuming your science skill
is high enough), you are given a list of possible passwords.  
Each time you try a password from the list, either it is the correct password and you are granted access to the computer,
or you are told how many characters in the attempted word match characters in the actual password.  
<b>The character and its position in the actual password must match</b>.  
By a process of elimination, it is then possible to determine the actual password. 
You have 4 tries to determine the correct password.

</p><p>

Read in a list of strings (possible passwords) from a text file.
The passwords will all be of the same length. 
The maximum number of passwords in the text file is 20 (MAX EQU 20).
The length of each password is 11 (LEN EQU 13 for the password, a carriage return, and a line feed--
LEN should be defined in your driver and passed to procedures that need it).
<b>Use an EQU to define LEN so that I can test your program with a different string length for the passwords</b>.
A password that starts with an "x" is interpreted as the sentinel value 
indicating that the user is done entering potential passwords.

</p><p>

Next, the user will enter which word that they tried as the password (the inputted index is 1-based), 
and the number of character matches reported by Fallout 3.
These values can also be read in from a text file as in my example input file.
The length of the integers will be the same as the length of the strings so use <b>regular input</b>
to read them in rather than inputW or inputD.
The updated list of possible passwords is displayed, and the user is then able
to guess another password from this updated list.  
If only one password remains (or zero if some kind of input error occurred), the program terminates.

         <li><b>Directly use movsb and repeat or use the loop instruction with lodsb and stosb</b> in this procedure</li>
         <li>When a string matches the number of characters, swap (don't overwrite) it with the smallest index string that doesn't match (pass two memory addresses to swap)</li>
         <li><b>Use either al or the stack for temporary swap space (no .DATA in the procedure!)</b></li>
